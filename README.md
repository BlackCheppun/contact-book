# contact-book
this is a small python app made with tkinter and sqlite3 database,
it's an app that saves your contacts in a data base and you can view you saved contact, PS: its manual 

you don't need to install libraries since tkinter ans sqlite3 comes with python :)

just make sure both files are in the same folder when you open them

one of them contains the front end of the app such as the buttons, text fields ... etc
the other contains the functions for the databse

ps: the database was made with classes so its an object oriented kind of code
